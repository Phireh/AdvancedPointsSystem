## Extending APS
For the extension developers amongst us, we have written a comprehensive Wiki that should describe everything in detail.
You can read about [Extending APS](https://github.com/phpBB-Studio/AdvancedPointsSystem/wiki/Extending-APS) and all [the possibilities](https://github.com/phpBB-Studio/AdvancedPointsSystem/wiki/Extending-possibilities) there are. If there are still any questions, feel free to ask.
